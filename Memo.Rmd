**Final Project Data Memo**

The dataset I selected includes information regarding the percentage of
poverty in the United States population since 1959. Data is distributed
in decimals according to poverty rates based on the categories: By age
group, By family type, By race/ethnicity, By Region and By State.

"Percent of people in poverty" is obtained from the the source USAFacts
found through the Google Dataset Search engine. The page offers graphs
visualizing the information provided in an Excel document with more than
3,000 observations. Predictors are the 50 states, 3 age groups, 5 family
types, 5 ethnic groups, and 4 regions.

There is missing data for all state poverty rates from 1959 to 1979 and
some data by region from 1959 to 1970. I believe the most effective way
to handle this task is to consider observations starting on 1980 since
all observations are complete and focus on contemporary circumstances.

With this project I would like to predict what combination of the
categories mentioned above is at risk of staying in poverty for the next
20 years. Also, this approach will determine the highest and lowest
poverty rates in the future. The response to this prediction can be
"Particular geographical, and demographic communities at risk of having
significant poverty in 20 years." The main question can be answered by a
regression approach because it will evaluate quantitative observations
and will set a ranking system. The most useful predictors can be racial
background and age since they can create a general perspective of
multiple communities across the United States. This outcome means that
we'll be able to predict communities that will remain affected by
poverty in the future and can be a call to action.

I'll start transferring data during the upcoming week, data analysis
exploration the following weeks, and have the project done two weeks
prior to the deadline to focus on small formatting and additional
details for context.

The main concerns I currently have are that I wanted to make sure basing
data from an Excel document is okay to use in R, and also what do you
recommend to do with the missing data. No other questions at the moment,
but would appreciate any feedback.
